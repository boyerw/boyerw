## Introduction
I am currently a domain expert at Outlier, where I create datasets for training chat bots in math reasoning and multimodal understanding. I received my Master's degree in Data Science from Harvard Extension School in March 2024. My capstone project studied computer vision algorithms for automated damage assessment and georeferencing in post-hurricane aerial imagery.
